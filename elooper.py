  # Automating the vamp_perform - model_train - model_export loop.
  # Elooper continues the tradition, builds on the experience from dlooper and attempts to simplify and streamline things
  # (first version will ditch the whole gsd aspects as they complicate things quite a lot;
  # the hope is that there will be more to gain from gsd with richer features - so that overfitting to a single problem will be easier)
